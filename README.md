# WiDS

Code for WiDS 2021 Competition hosted on Kaggle.  See  [my write up on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/widsdatathon2021/discussion/223122) for an overview of the code.  It is an end to end workflow using RAPIDS (cupy, cudf and cuml) and XGBoost. For RAPIDS and XGBoost installation best is to create a new conda environment as shown on [RAPIDS.ai site](https://rapids.ai/start.html#get-rapids).  I used RAPIDS 0.17.

hospital_map_all file can be recreated from the code shared in [this Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/cpmpml/mapping-test-hospitals-to-train-hospitals).  See [this discussion](https://www.kaggle.com/c/widsdatathon2021/discussion/222982) for an explanation.
